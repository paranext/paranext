## Users

This software is not yet ready for users. We'll update here with where you can install it when its ready.

## Developer Install

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paranext/paranext.git
cd paranext
npm install
```

## Starting Development

Start the app in the `dev` environment:

```bash
npm start
```

## Packaging for Production

To package apps for the local platform:

```bash
npm run package
```

## Linux Development

Add the system libraries needed for Electron, [Build Instructions (Linux)](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/development/build-instructions-linux).

## Windows Development with WSL2

On Windows, you can install [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) (Windows Subsystem for Linux) so you can test cross-platform compatibility on Linux (as well as Windows). You'll need to use a Linux distribution with WSL2 (rather than WSL1) so the X-Server windows can be opened for Electron.

1. Here is how to [install Linux on Windows with WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
2. You'll want to follow that by setting up to use **VS Code**, **Git** and **NodeJS** with WSL. See the various [tutorials](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment).
3. In the WSL distribution, add system libraries needed for Electron, see [Linux Development](#linux-development) above.
4. In the WSL distribution, clone the repo as described above under [Developer Install](#developer-install).

You'll be running a copy of the repo in both Windows and WSL so make sure they are both up-to-date.
